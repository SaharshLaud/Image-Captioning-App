# Image Captioning App
Deep Learning based application for generating captions for uploaded images.



This is a web-based Machine Learning application for image caption generation. 
It uses Python based web development framework - **Flask** and machine learning library **Keras** along with **OpenCV** to train a ResNet and LSTM Neural Network models and to train the machine and generate captions for unknown images using the power of neural networks.

The user can upload their images into the model and the deep learning model tries to generate a caption describing the features in that image.
